It unlocks advanced capabilities related to analytics that would otherwise be difficult to achieve with traditional data warehousing architectures. In a traditional data warehouse, analytics requirements can be achieved using a top-down (deductive) approach based on known reporting requirements. However, with advanced analytical requirements in machine learning use cases, reporting outputs are unknown at the start, requiring an iterative exploratory analysis phase by data scientists. The MDW architecture enables both traditional (top-down) and advanced (bottom-up) analytical workloads such as business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) to coexist. Additionally, the MDW enables schema-on-read access, which is crucial for exploratory analysis and supports storage of both structured and unstructured datasets, required for advanced analytics use cases. The ELT approach for data loading in MDW is preferred over ETL, which is preferred in traditional data warehousing, as it enables transformation post-data ingestion and storage.
